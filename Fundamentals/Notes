Imperative code - You tell the computer how to do something

var numbers = [4,2,3,6]
var total = 0
for (var i =0; i < numbers.length; i++){
  total += numbers[i]
}

Declarative code - You tell the computer what you want it to do.

var numbers = [4,2,3,6]
numbers.reduce(function(previous, current) {
  return previous + current
})

Using declarative code is more readable, has less bugs, reduces side effects, and minimizes mutability.

React has explicit mutations using this.setState

React Router - allows you to map components to be active when you are at different URLs.

<Router history={hashHistory}>
  <Route path = '/' component={Main}>
    <IndexRoute component={Home} />
    <Route path='playerOne' header='Player One' component={PromptContainer} />
    <Route path='playerTwo/:playerOne' header='Player Two' component={PromptContainer}/>
    <Route path='battle' component={ConfirmBattleContainer} />
    <Route path='results' component={ResultsContainer} />
  </Route>
</Router>
